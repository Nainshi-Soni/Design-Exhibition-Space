            <p class="p-3">A resume is a professional document that summarizes an individualâ€™s education, work experience, skills, and accomplishments. It is typically used when applying for jobs, internships, or academic opportunities. The goal of a resume is to present your qualifications in a clear, concise, and structured format that makes it easy for employers to evaluate your suitability for a role. <br>

            A standard resume includes key sections like contact information, career objective or summary, education background, work or internship experience, technical and soft skills, and optionally, certifications, projects, or languages. A well-written resume is tailored to the specific job, uses action verbs, quantifiable achievements, and is usually limited to one or two pages. It plays a crucial role in making a strong first impression during the hiring process.</p>
