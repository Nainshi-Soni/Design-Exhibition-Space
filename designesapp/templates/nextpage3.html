            <p class="p-3">Invitation cards are written or digital messages used to invite people to special events such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, corporate events, and ceremonies. They serve as a formal or informal request for the presence of guests and provide key details about the event. <br>

            A typical invitation card includes the event name, hostâ€™s name, date, time, venue, and sometimes RSVP information or special instructions (like dress code or theme). These cards not only inform guests but also set the tone for the occasion through their design, wording, and presentation. <br>

            Invitation cards can be printed, digital (e-cards), or even video-based, and are often designed to match the theme or mood of the event. They play an important role in planning by helping manage attendance and creating a positive first impression of the celebration.</p>
